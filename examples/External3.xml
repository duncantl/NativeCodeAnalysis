  The fastmatch package has one call to .External
  It calls a routine in ctapply.c.
  When we generate the IR file, we don't see any calls
  to CAR and CDR. This is  because that file
  defines USE_RINTERNALS so the computations from the macros are inlined
  rather than calls to CAR and CDR routines.
  We can either deal with those or comment out the line that defines USE_RINTERNALS.
