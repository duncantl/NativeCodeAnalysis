Package: NativeCodeAnalysis
Title: Tools to analyze native code (C/C++)
Description: This provids functionality to analyze C and C++ code in various ways.
   It works with both the compiled version of the code as LLVM's Intermediate Representation
   and also the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the original C/C++ code.
   Both are necessary for completeness as the compilation removes names of fields, etc. in data structures.
   The analysis will include R-object type inference from .Call (and sub) routines, memory management identificatio
  (e.g. which routine allocates memory or not), identifying read and write arguments,
  presence of side-effects on non-local data structures (e.g. on the Graphics devices or options)
